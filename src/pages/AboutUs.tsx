        <p>
          &emsp;Caige and Elise have known each other since they were five years old, starting their journey together in Mrs. Hepner’s kindergarten class. Throughout school, they remained close friends. By junior year of high school, Caige was driving Elise to school so she wouldn’t have to take the bus. That same year, Elise even convinced him to be her prom date!
          <br /><br />
          &emsp;Fast forward to college, both ended up attending Shippensburg University. During their sophomore year, Elise joined Caige’s friend group, and from then on, they spent nearly every weekend together. Elise graduated in May 2022 and moved to Chambersburg to teach autistic support in the local school district. Although Caige had one more semester left, the two stayed in close contact. In fact, Caige once told Elise that if she ever needed an excuse to get out of a date, she could text him and he’d be there in a heartbeat.

          &emsp;Caige graduated in December 2022, and they celebrated the milestone with their friends. After graduation, he began his career in Mechanicsburg and moved back home to Norry. Meanwhile, he and Elise continued to grow closer—spending more time together at the gym, visiting State College with her family, going to brewfests, and enjoying game nights at her house. Elise was home nearly every weekend just to see Caige.

          &emsp;In April 2023, Elise hosted a birthday celebration at her parents' house. Her best friend and future maid of honor, Sarah, decided it was the perfect night for Caige and Elise to finally admit their feelings for each other—separately, of course! The next morning, Caige showed up at the VanKirks’ and asked Elise out on a date. She said yes. That weekend, he drove down to Chambersburg for their first official date, and the two quickly fell in love, spending every moment they could together.

          &emsp;In May 2024, Caige proposed to Elise in Keithan’s Gardens—the very place they took their junior prom photos. She said yes, and in June 2024, they moved to Shippensburg together. Today, Elise and Caige live there with their two cats, Milo and Sharkbait. Elise is a learning support teacher in the Chambersburg School District, and Caige continues to advance in his career in Mechanicsburg.
